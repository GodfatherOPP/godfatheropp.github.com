        <h1>what is python?</h1><br><br>
            Python is a widely used high-level programming language created by
        Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s. The language places strong
        emphasis on code readability and simplicity, making it possible for
        rogrammers to develop applications rapidly.<br><br>
        Like all high level programming languages, Python code resembles the
        English language which computers are unable to understand. Codes that
        we write in Python have to be interpreted by a special program known as
        the Python interpreter, which weâ€™ll have to install before we can code, test
        and execute our Python programs. We will look at how to install the Python
        interpreter in Chapter 2.<br><br>
        There are also a number of third-party tools, such as Py2exe or
        Pyinstaller that allow us to package our Python code into stand-alone
        executable programs for some of the most popular operating systems like
        Windows and Mac OS. This allows us to distribute our Python programs
        without requiring the users to install the Python interpreter.<br><br>
